# Car Maintenance ML Model with Backend API
I was inspired to do this side project after reading Balwant Gorad medium article, where his focus was to build complete end-to-end ML model, Backend RestAPI using FastAPI. His data set included a Car Price Prediction. 

My goal was to do it differently.

## Hot to Run this Project
```sh
cd src
python run train.py
cd ../api
python run backend.py //to run the backend
```
